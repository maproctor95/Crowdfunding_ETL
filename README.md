# Crowdfunding_ETL
## Overview of Project

* Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
* Create the Campaign DataFrame
* Create the Contacts DataFrame
* Create the Crowdfunding Database
 
### Purpose

I am utilizing Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from a xlsx file in order to get more detailed information about what the pulled data shows.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* During this assignment I was able to complete all the goals and objectives for the assignment. I used what I have learned in the class to trouble shoot the code as I went with Jupyter Notebook and made sure I was fully understanding what each part of my code did through labeling, so when an error popped up I knew how to approach the problem.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* I think the biggest challenge for me was figured out how to monipulate the data using pandas and starting from an excel file. I hit a lot of errors and road blocks, but breaks and repetition won over and eventually I figured out what I needed to do.
